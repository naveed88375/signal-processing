# Description
This repository contains embedded system prototyping projects using embedded micro-controller boards such as Arduino, Raspberry-Pi and others. Since these are hardware tools, thus it would need the required boards and sensors to implement them, however the provided code can be utilized which I have extensively documented using code comments. For some of the projects, I have also demonstrated their working using Proteus simulation suite.
