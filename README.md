# Description
This repository contains digital signal processing projects and tasks. I have mainly used MATLAB programming software for the presented work since it is the most popular software when it comes to processing digital signals using a computer. The code is open source and is intended to help researchers and professionals in the field. Feel free to contact me incase of any clarifications.
